Hi, there!

I'm Omar Luna.
I'm interested in computer sciences, specially the kernel Linux, device drivers, system tools and OS development in general.
I'm a self-taught hobbist.
I'm fluent in Assembly, C, C++, Java, C# and PHP languages, but I can also write programs in Bash and other modern programming languages like Go, Python or Kotlin.
I'm also interested in System, Server, and Database Administration.
